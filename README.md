# node-hook

This script for git hook aims to create and update a git project with a structure of folder of git projects.
It is needed because in folder of git projects there are many files out of the git projects but all of them are important.
So, I create a especific git project it contains this structure and add all of files, in yours repectives directories except the git projects.
